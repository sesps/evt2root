* evt2root
This program converts files generated by ASICS (`.evt` files) to file read by ROOT (`.root` files).

Description: Takes `.evt` files from a list and converts them to ROOT format. 
The file `evt_files.list` specifies the location and name of the ouput ROOT
file on the first line. Only one ROOT file is generated. The second line is
the directory where all the data files are located. The list of run numbers
is the remainder of the file. This script also needs a library where the
detectors classes are defined.

** Versions
Two version of this code exist, depending on the electonics setup.
*** `evt2root_NSCL11.C`
Version used by Texas A&M University. Adopted & tested for the NSCLDAQ11 version.

*** `evt2root_NSCL11_mADC.C`
Version used by Florida State University, generalized to include Mesytec modules. 

** Requirements
make sure your `.evt` files are included in the `evt_files.list`
`evt_files.list`


** Execution
to run it: 
```
root -l
.x VM_BaseClass.cpp+
.L VM_Module.cpp+
.L SimpleInPipe.cpp+
.x evt2root_NSCL11.C+
```
This list of commands is contained within the file `rootinput.txt`.
```
root -l < rootinput.txt
```

*** Batch mode
The file `data.cpp` allows the user to convert a list of files in batch mode.
Description: Runs evt2root on the files listed in `runs.lst`. User has option of deleting the `.evt` files after conversion. The commands run for each conversion are listed in `rootinput.txt`. The location of the data files (input) and ROOT files (output) are specified in the code. The use of this code will generate a seperate ROOT file for each run.
 
**** Requires:
>`runs.lst`
>`rootinput.txt`
 
**** Output:
